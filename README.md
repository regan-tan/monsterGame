Monster Game is a single player game where the player get's to fight a monster

When you “ATTACK”, the monster suffers some (random) damage and its health bar reduces accordingly. 

When you “SPECIAL ATTACK”, the monster would generally suffer more damage than usual. "SPECIAL ATTACKS" have a 3 second timeout.

At the same time, the monster attacks back and you suffers some damage and your health bar reduces accordingly.

“HEAL”: you will be (randomly) awarded with some health and your health bar increases accordingly. You can only use "HEAL" when your health/points is below 80%.

When the Monster's health is zero, you win the game. “START NEW GAME” button appears again, allowing you to restart the game.

“GIVE UP”: You can choose to give up and leave the game at any time of the game. By clicking the button, you acknowledge defeat and the Monster happily EATS you

This project is an extension of a class exercise given in school as part of a Vue.JS course. I completed the basic functionalities and made some changes to make the game more realistic.
